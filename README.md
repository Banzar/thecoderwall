##The Coder Wall

This is going to be a compilation of my code and my programs, so that I could use my own site as my portfolio. I will also use some of the videos I have made and will be making to give tips and to help others.

This project is in the beginning stages, I have created a blog so far, I figured this would be used to get help from others on projects, I will also be coding challenges, I want to be challenged to make myself better and be able to do anything that comes to me.
